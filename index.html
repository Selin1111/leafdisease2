        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to detect diseases affecting plantain leaves based on uploaded images. The objective is to assist farmers and agricultural specialists in identifying potential issues early, thereby improving crop yield and quality.</p>
        <p>Once an image is uploaded, the system analyzes the leaf condition and provides a diagnosis along with detailed descriptions of any identified diseases. This tool is designed to be user-friendly, making it accessible for individuals without a technical background.</p>
